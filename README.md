Project Overview:
The main goal of this project is organizing the data and finding the success mantra for crowdfundingâ€™s based on the successful campaigns from the past. This will help to ensure the same success for future projects too. This project also analyzes which categories had succeeded and failed most. Goal analysis to find out which goals are successful among all.
Process:
I have analyzed all the data provided in the crowdfunding. I started with Outcomes from the previous projects by changing the colors based on successful, failed, canceled and live. Calculated the percent funded based on the goal and pledged. I have color coded both the columns by using Conditional formatting. Converted the category columns by using Text to columns from the data. Created pivot charts to analyze the data of parent category and outcomes similarly created one more for subcategory and outcomes too. Converted the launched and deadline timestamps to find out the dates when they launched and ended the campaign to create line chart of outcomes monthly wise.
Analysis:
*Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
1. Based on the previous projects, the more success rate is for plays and rock music and the lowest success rate is for world music, audio, metal and radio podcasts. The interesting point is most failed and canceled projects are plays.
2. we can also see that the months of June and July are the best leading months because they have had more successful campaigns in the past. The months which produced failed outcome are January, May and August.
3. Most of the projects were held with goal range from 5000 to 9999. The more failed and canceled projects are also from same goal range.
 
* What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. The campaigns held in January and May could have wait until Jun and July to make their campaigns successful.
2. The goal range of 5000 to 9999 might reduce their goal change to <4999 to become more successful than more failed campaigns.
 
*What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
1. Creating a graph by using categories, outcomes and duration of the campaign (launched date -deadline) shows how they achieve their goal in less time.
2. Creating a graph by including country also adds more value to the analysis. To find out the successful and failed campaigns based on the location will help to improve future predictions.
